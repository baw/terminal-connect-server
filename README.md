Terminal Connect Server
========

Terminal Connect will be a platform to receive information about long running processes that you begin running from your terminal/console.  This is the server part of the platform that receives the command, output, and exit code from a process that you run and processes it.

At the begin this server will only display the command and output from the process on a website, but more features will be added.
